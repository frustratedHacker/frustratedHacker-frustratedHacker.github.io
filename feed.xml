Many of you will have an idea about childhood’s play CTF. In which we had few teams looking for their flag. CTF for cybersecurity is almost the same as the “on-field” one. The Ancient Romans used a board game version of CTF games to train their children in war strategy and battle formations. In 20... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Integer Overflow</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/posts/integer_overflow/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Integer Overflow" /><published>2021-01-12T00:00:00+05:30</published> <updated>2021-01-12T00:00:00+05:30</updated> <id>http://localhost:4000/posts/integer_overflow/</id> <content src="http://localhost:4000/posts/integer_overflow/" /> <author> <name>grunkleStan</name> </author> <category term="Binary Exploitation" /> <summary> Hey Guys, Let’s talk about Integer overflow! Overflow is nothing but the accesive flow. Consider an empty glass. If you feel it with the liquid, it will start filling (it sounds stupid). After some point, the glass will be full and the liquid will be all over the floor. That is liquid overflow where we added liquid to a glass beyound its capacity. Integer overflow is no different. If yo... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Introduction To Binary Exploitation</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/posts/Introduction_To_Binary_Exploitation/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Introduction To Binary Exploitation" /><published>2021-01-04T00:00:00+05:30</published> <updated>2021-01-04T00:00:00+05:30</updated> <id>http://localhost:4000/posts/Introduction_To_Binary_Exploitation/</id> <content src="http://localhost:4000/posts/Introduction_To_Binary_Exploitation/" /> <author> <name>grunkleStan</name> </author> <category term="Binary Exploitation" /> <summary> Hey Guys, Let’s get started with binary exploitation! What is binary exploitation? Binary exploitation is the process of subverting a compiled application such that it violates some trust boundary in a way that is advantageous to you, the attacker. The basic goal behind binary exploitation is to gain control of a shell (Command line interface of the system) or to modify the functioning of a ... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Binary Exploitation Vs Reverse Engineering</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/posts/Binary_Exploitation_&amp;_Reverse_Engineering/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Binary Exploitation Vs Reverse Engineering" /><published>2020-12-31T00:00:00+05:30</published> <updated>2020-12-31T00:00:00+05:30</updated> <id>http://localhost:4000/posts/Binary_Exploitation_&amp;_Reverse_Engineering/</id> <content src="http://localhost:4000/posts/Binary_Exploitation_&amp;_Reverse_Engineering/" /> <author> <name>grunkleStan</name> </author> <category term="General" /> <summary> Hey Guys, Let’s start with some basics. Binary exploitation and reverse engineering might sound confusing sometimes. Consider you have a Milkshake and you have to identify the ingredients. We can guess it by the colour and the taste. Basically, in the milkshake, milk and the sugar are common so we only will have to identify fruit. That’s reverse engineering. Talking in the computer terms, gu... </summary> </entry> </feed>
